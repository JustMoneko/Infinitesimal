## About PIU Infinitesimal
This theme aims to be a spiritual successor to Pump It Up Infinity, an uncommon StepMania-based spin-off developed by Team Infinity and licensed by Andamiro. The current goals are to replicate the look and feel of Infinity while sprinkling in new additions and quality of life improvements, utilize original assets when possible and bring high performance to the table with StepMania 5.3/OutFox.

**It is important to state that we do not condone the usage of Pay Mode or the removal of the credits on this theme. If such things are done, we will unfortunately start to block off bits of source code or give up on the project altogether.**

## Requirements
* StepMania 5.3 OutFox Alpha 4.9.7 or newer

Other versions such as `5.0.12` and `5.1-new` are not supported due to the lack of maintenance to `pump` and the engine in general. Support the developers from Team Rizu who are currently doing the heavy lifting!

## Installing
Download from the `Code > Download ZIP` button, extract the .zip file and place the folder it in `/Appearance/Themes`. Since this theme is currently on a rolling release, we highly recommend cloning the theme instead with `git` and pull subsequent updates that are pushed to the repository.

**If you are upgrading from a previous version by Download ZIP, fully delete the old folder first. Do not merge the new folder into the old.**

## Custom Wallpapers
Infinitesimal displays randomly selected wallpapers during the profile saving screen after every song. You can add your own by dropping any wallpaper inside of the `/Graphics/Wallpapers` directory. You're free to remove the existing ones or add new ones as you like!
